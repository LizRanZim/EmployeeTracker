Create package.json with mysql2, inquirer and console.table and express dependencies
Run npm install
Set up db schema
Set up db seeds
Set up db queries (make asynchronous?)
Set up process.env stuff
Set up inquirer functions
Set up inquirer queries
Tie inquirer response to console.table
Set up console.table functionality for view all departments as a test
Set up process.env variables
Set up classes for employee, role, department, manager?

//
Once everything is set up, think about what order the steps will need to happen in

See a menu with these options:

Show menu 
    Create a function that shows the menu of options at the start
    Call the showMenu function at the completion of each set of activities below

View all employees
    this will run a function that Select * From employees and prints that table in the console

Add an employee
    this will run a function that asks for the first_name, last_name, role (choose from list), who is employee's manager,(choose from list of managers)


    (pull list of managers dynamically from db as choices in inquirer)

    (pull list of roles dynamically from db as choices in inquirer)

    see example here for that: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46210279/pass-objects-in-array-into-inquirer-list-choices

    do you need a class? eg employee then new Employee

    once you have that info, run a function to insert that data into the employees table
    
    console.log a confirm message that the data has been added

    call showMenu

Update an employee role
    this will run a function that asks which employee role you want to Update (choose from list)

    then it will ask what role would you like to choose for that employee (choose from list)

    console.log a confirm message that the data has been updated

     call showMenu


View all roles
    this will run a function that Select * From role and prints that table in the console

Add a role
    this will run a function that asks for the name of the role, the salary of the role, and asks which department the role belongs to (select from a list of choices)

    console.log a confirm message that the data has been added to the database

    call showMenu


View all departments
    this will run a function that Select * From department and prints that table in the console

Add a department
    this will run a function that asks for the name of the department you want to add
    
    this will run a function that Inserts the name of the department into the department table

    console.log a confirm message that the data has been added to the database
    
    call showMenu

Quit

Notes on console.table

const cTable = require('console.table');

const table = cTable.getTable([
  {
    name: 'foo',
    age: 10
  }, {
    name: 'bar',
    age: 20
  }
]);

console.log(table);

// prints
name  age
----  ---
foo   10
bar   20

var values = [
  ['max', 20],
  ['joe', 30]
];
console.table(['name', 'age'], values);
 
name  age
----  ---
max   20 
joe   30
